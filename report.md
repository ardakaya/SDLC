## Final Answer:
To successfully set up and configure CI/CD pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment, I will outline the detailed steps using a popular CI/CD tool such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions. Let's use GitHub Actions for this example since it's widely integrated with repositories and is fully managed.

1. **Repository Setup:**
   Make sure your code repository (e.g., GitHub) is well-organized and includes the necessary configurations for your application (such as Dockerfile, build scripts, tests, etc.).

2. **Create Workflow File:**
   In your repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it. Within the `workflows` directory, create a YAML file for your workflow, for example, `ci-cd-pipeline.yml`.

3. **Define the Workflow:**
   In your `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file, you will configure the steps for your CI/CD pipeline.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
      
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: | 
        echo "Deploy logic goes here, e.g., using AWS CLI or other deployment tools"
```

4. **CI Steps:**
   - **Check out the Code**: Use `actions/checkout@v2` to access the repository contents.
   - **Set up Environment**: Configure the necessary environment, such as setting up Node.js with `actions/setup-node@v2`.
   - **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or the equivalent for your language to install project dependencies.
   - **Run Tests**: Execute tests using `npm test` or a similar command for your project language.

5. **CD Steps:**
   - The `deploy` job ensures deployment steps are only executed after successful completion of the `build` job, specifically on merges to the main branch.
   - Customize deployment actions for your target environment, for example, using serverless, AWS ECS, or other cloud services.

6. **Environment Variables and Secrets:**
   - Use GitHub Secrets to manage sensitive data such as API keys, secrets, and credentials required for deployment.

7. **Monitor Workflow Runs:**
   - Once your CI/CD pipeline is configured and you push changes to your repository, observe workflow runs in the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository.
   - Monitor any failures and iterate to enhance the pipeline.

8. **Optimizations and Best Practices:**
   - Utilize caching for dependencies to speed up your builds.
   - Implement matrix builds if you need to test multiple environments or configurations.

By following these steps and carefully configuring your `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file, you should achieve a functional CI/CD pipeline, meeting the criteria of successful test runs and automated deployment. This setup ensures ongoing deployments are reliable and streamlined as your development progresses.
